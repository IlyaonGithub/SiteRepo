    I started my education in Russia. I studied there until Year 4 (inclusive). Later on I moved to Chile and studied in the Nido de Aguilas International School in Santiago from Year 5 to Year 7 (inclusive).
    I then studied in GWUOHS online for Year 8 and proceeded to move to the Balearic Islands of Spain, where I moved to a British Education System in 2021. I am currently in Year 10 of IGCSE in Green Valley School in Mallorca.
